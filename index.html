    Welcome to the world of food, experienced through me, Claire.</p>
    <p>This food archive is inspired by my love of food: tasting and eating. While recipes are not featured on this site, many of the foods I discuss I have personally made. Some recipes come from 
        cookbooks, some from friends, some from a quick Google search: "easy vegetarian recipes that taste good."</p>
