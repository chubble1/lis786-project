<p>This food archive was inspired by my love of food: tasting and eating. While recipes are not featured on this site, many of the foods I discuss I have personally made. Some recipes come from 
    cookbooks, some from friends, some from a quick Google search: "easy vegetarian recipes that taste good."</p>
