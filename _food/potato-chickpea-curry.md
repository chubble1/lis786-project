Curry is such a warm hug dish for me. Every time I eat it, the anger and sorrow of my tiny world disappears and I am a happier, more caring, more empathetic version of myself. And all because of curry powder and some golden potatoes.

This recipe really inspired me when I first made it. I don't know if it is the physical smushing of potatoes that gets me excited, or the fact that it looks like real, proper curry at the end of my hard work. It's also a very short cooking time, using really accessible cooking skills being used. I feel like I can *really* cook when I make this meal!

A lime-cilantro yogurt dressing is drizzled on top of the rice and curry, finished with more fried onions on top for a nice crunch. I like to add fresh jalapeno on top to give it an extra kick, but any hot sauce pairs well with the cool yogurt on top.
