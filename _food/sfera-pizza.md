After a full day at Osterman Beach, the closest \(and best\) snack to pick up is quite literally anything from Sfera Sicilian Street Food, mere blocks from the water.

Let me begin by saying: this slice was huge. The bread was foccacia-like, the bread crumbs on top complimented the cheese nicely. I could have gone for more sauce, but I love a saucy pizza and think the ratio was great for these purposes. There is nothing like the first real meal after a day at the beach. Your body is sunburnt and tired, your hair is only half dried, you're slightly tipsy off the many beers drunk throughout the day. This pizza was absolute heaven and showed up in my life at the perfect time.
