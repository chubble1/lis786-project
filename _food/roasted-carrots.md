One of my favorite dishes from one of my favorite cookbooks, Love Real Food. Tanner and I are obsessed with these rainbow carrots, the star of this plate. 

There is nothing a good tahini sauce can't fix--not that the gorgeous rainbow carrots we always seem to find at Jewel-Osco need much saving. After almost an hour in the oven, they are so tender and sweet. Mixed with a savory tahini sauce, pepitas for a crunch on top, and laid on a bed of farro--it feels so luxurious. I am really relieved as a vegetarian when I find a dish that fills and fulfills me like this one does. I love vegetables! And maybe I do love to cook!
