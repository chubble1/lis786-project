Perhaps it's because I grew up making muffins from box recipes instead of from scratch, but I am always shocked when muffin recipes yield less than 12 muffins. This recipe makes 8, but it is so worth it every single time. 

It's impossible to not crack one in half seconds after removing it from the oven. I especially love the fresh blueberries that have burst while baking--they seep into the muffin batter and create beautiful purple veins throughout. Honeslty, this is a go-to breakast paired with some egg muffins or a yogurt. They are not the healthiest muffin, using vegetable oil and plenty of sugar, but they are a show stopper. The perfect recipe when blueberries are cheap at the local Jewel.
