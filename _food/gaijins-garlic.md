At Gaijin in Chicago's Fulton Market District, there is so much food to enjoy. At the top of the list for me has to be their appetizer: twice-cooked garlic and senbei crackers. To die for. 

This is also one of the only sake flights close by--and we still had a half hour train ride. The garlic dish is perfection: slightly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. On top of the cracker, it is perfection. Gaijin has a lot to offer foodies in my opinion! The other appetizer we ordered \(because we are absolute fiends for fried vegetables\) the veggie tempura. Thanks to the senbei crackers, both dishes were the perfect crispy addition to our entrees and drinks. 10/10 will be going back for the garlic.
