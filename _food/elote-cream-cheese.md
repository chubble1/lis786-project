The newest coffee shop in my neighborhood is a coffee shop that does not accept tips. I have been twice so far, and both times my order totaled $8.80 for a 12 oz signature drink and a bagel with cream cheese. 

I remember a time when a bagel with cream cheese and a latte cost me $7 or less, but $8.80 is the most reasonable price I have encountered in a long time. \(Compare this to when Tanner and I visited a second new coffee shop and paid $17 for two cold brew coffees.\)

I digress. What I'm here to talk about is the *elote cream cheese* that rested on my toasted everything bagel. Yes: elote cream cheese, filled with corn and jalapeno pieces. The spiciness was cooled off the by temperature of the cream cheese. I never eat plain bagels, and this might be a cream cheese worth eating even if plain bagels are the only option. The bagel itself was good, but the star of this show was the schmear.
