Hi, my name is Claire. This is my food archive.

*Claire, how is a food archive different from a food blog?* I'm glad you asked! This food archive is here for me mostly, and doesn't include time stamps on when I ate the food or uploaded new content to the site. Though archives are famous for their time-stamping abilities, I like to think of this site as a more personal archive focused on tasting and eating and loving the food that I buy and make and share.

When I'm not eating food, I'm a real life librarian as of May 2025, when I graduated with an MLIS degree. Yes, I love cookbooks! I need a better way to store mine. I am also a vegetarian, which heavily influences what I eat and what I enjoy eating \(obviously\). I became a vegetarian in 2017 as a New Year's resolution and never looked back. It really has been such a great experience for me. I made another site \(in another LIS class\) dedicated to different cheese sandwiches of my life.

- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner
